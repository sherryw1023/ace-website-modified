									<header class="major"><h2>Our Secondary School Application Process</h2></header>
									<p>Our secondary school application process begins with a comprehensive evaluation of each student interested in studying abroad. We conduct in-depth interviews with both the student and their parents to assess the student's overall readiness for this important step. Based on the results, we provide honest, personalized recommendations to help parents determine whether studying abroad is the right path for their child.</p>
									<p>Our assessment covers multiple dimensions, including academic background, English proficiency, personality traits, learning ability, family education background, independence, motivation for studying abroad, academic initiative, study habits, and more.</p>
									<p>Over the years, we’ve worked with a diverse range of students and observed the unique journeys and outcomes of those who pursued an overseas education. These experiences have reinforced our belief that studying abroad is not suitable for every child. Our mission is to help families make well-informed and rational decisions about their children's educational paths.</p>
									<p>For students who come to the United States at a young age, we provide a full range of support services to ease their transition. From airport pickup and setting up bank accounts and phone plans, to resolving conflicts with host families, addressing school-related concerns, and assisting with school transfers when needed, we are committed to being there every step of the way.</p>
									<p>While helping students adjust to academic and daily life in the U.S. is our immediate goal, our broader mission is to offer a platform for holistic development. We aim to cultivate critical life skills such as adaptability, communication, public speaking, self-advocacy, leadership, community engagement, listening, and debating. Ultimately, we want our students to thrive academically and personally, develop a global outlook, and grow into individuals who contribute meaningfully to their communities.</p>
