									<header class="major"><h2>Student from Chile</h2></header>
									<p>When I found Dr. Zhang, it was already late December. Because ED and EA had rejected us, we analyzed that the essay may have had a problem. And the prospect of other schools, that we have already submitted applications for are not optimistic. Before the deadline on January 1, I need to re-apply to a batch of schools. My friend introduced Dr. Zhang's team who are very good at essay guidance. After making a remote video communication, Dr. Zhang quickly discovered a few qualities worthy of being revealed in my child, as the theme of Essay. After that, we applied for the top 18 schools of US News before January 5. All Essays were guided and revised by Dr. Zhang and her husband, Mr. Phil. As a result, two schools out of seven and one school in the waiting list admitted me. Compared with the 15 top out of 50 that were applied for, only four schools gave us an offer, and the best one is ranked 30th. The difference is mainly in essay. Dr. Zhang and Mr. Phil have a unique understanding of essay, knowing what qualities are worth exploring and how to choose essay topics in order to closely follow these qualities. Essay that is guided by them can properly show the strengths of the child and give the child a lot of points, which has completely different effects. Thank you again for Dr. Zhang’s team. </p>
									
									<header class="major"><h2>Student from Shanghai, China</h2></header>
									<p>It’s a coincidence that I met Teacher Zhang but now I think I am destined to meet her.</p>
									<p>I used to never think about going abroad. I was in full swing in preparation for the domestic postgraduate examination last year. I was confident that I would definitely be admitted, but I found that I regretted losing it on the day of the query score in February this year. I asked myself to find out: I have a strong desire to continue studying abroad, and I am not incapable of studying abroad. So with the support of my parents and the encouragement of my friends, I decided to consult about going abroad. I met Dr. Zhang Li through a friend's introduction.</p>
									<p>Before I got to know the process of going abroad and made a final decision, I also consulted many study-abroad agents in China, but after comparison, I chose Teacher Zhang. Why did I choose her team? First of all, the domestic study-abroad agents required me to get an IELTS score of 7.5 and said that the situation for me can only allow me to re-enter the school in US next spring. I think that the excessively high requirements for language scores means that they are not confident enough about their clerical guidance. Secondly, although the price of domestic study-abroad agents seems to be cost-effective, it is required to fill the 80-100 schools in North America as a guarantee, and if they are admitted to the top 10 universities, they will be charged an additional fee of 10,000 yuan outside the contract. However, Dr. Zhang is gentle and considerate. In the process of communication with her, I felt I was encouraged. Dr. Zhang made it clear at the beginning that I can definitely enter the school this fall, and it is in the best top 50 American Colleges and Universities. All I need to do is prepare for the IELTS and GRE, and leave the rest for her to handle.</p>
									<p>On the day of confirming the contract with Dr. Zhang, I felt that my dream would continue and come true soon.</p>
									<p>Facts have proven that my choice is correct. With my own efforts and luck, In March, my IELTS test reached a satisfaction score of 7.0. At the end of April, all the materials needed for six schools of US were submitted. In May, I received the offers from the three schools including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Boston University and Fordham University. I finally chose my favorite TESOL as major in Boston University. From the ranking point of view, in just two months, I was admitted by Boston University that ranked 39th in US while a domestic graduate school that ranked mote than 100th in China did not admit me. My example seems to be a miracle in the eyes of others, but I know that all this is due to the help of Teacher Zhang. In my opinion, her paperwork is very efficient and extremely high quality. Her husband will further polish the impeccable instrument. Each piece of material is a perfect piece of work and a high-level summary of my own academic experience. In the United States, these graduate schools generally need a GPA of 3.0 and above. I didn't expect that my 2.74 GPA could break through the encirclement and be admitted by Boston University. It must be that Teacher Zhang's paperwork has added a lot of sparks to me.</p>
									<p>I have gained a lot in this graduation season. My parents are also proud of me. In the end, I still have to sincerely thank Teacher Zhang for her fulfilling my dream and making my life more fulfilling!</p>

									<p>I am very happy to know Dr. Zhang, a particularly sincere American study planner! My child and I always wish that we had known her long ago. These days Dr. Zhang has helped us solve the confusion that has plagued us for more than two months, which I am really appreciative for! Because we hadn't found a teacher who could make us understand our needs since we started making plans for our children. We had been sleeping badly for more than two months, because we didn't want to give up this goal, so we had found many teachers to see if there could be direction and if we could continue to accept the challenge? At this confused time, my friend recommended Dr. Zhang to us. My friend said that Dr. Zhang is the person who you need and definitely she will help you solve the problem. We were eager to give a lot of confused questions to Dr. Zhang! I didn't expect her to work hard to help us to make detailed consultations, and to analyze the confusion for us with great patience and care. I remember once she spent 4 hours discussing the problem with us, which was really rare! After two consecutive days, she continued to pay attention to the US official immigration office to help us solve the problem clearly. Dr. Zhang tried her best to help us before we paid the service fee! I am very grateful. I really can't express her sincerity in words. I really hope that she can return to China to open a study-abroad consulting company. I believe that she can help many children and families solve the confusion of studying abroad and I also believe that there are many families and children who are confused like us! Because it is a big thing for children to study abroad, they must plan ahead and learn more about specific problems. Otherwise, they will spend lots of time and pay huge money but without solving the problems. Thank you very much Dr. Zhang!</p>

									<p>I met Zhang Li in January 2016. We sent our son to study in the United States. The late arrival of the connecting plane caused us to get no luggage at the US airport. And because of the language barrier, we were very anxious. Dr. Zhang picked us up at the plane. We were touched by her sincerity, generosity and beauty. She helped us to check the baggage at the enquiry office. At the same time, she had been comforting us. We were in full security with her around us. I knew that luggage could be sent directly to the hotel after two days. We were very pleased that she took us for more than three hours to Long Island, the city where my son studied. Along the way she explained to us the work, the basic situation of my son's school. We were chatting freely, not like it was the first time to meet but more like old friends who had not seen each other for a long time. In a blink of an eye, my son has been studying in the United States for two and a half years. During this period, Zhang Li has been helping us to communicate with my son in the school and the home-stay family, so that we do not need to worry too much. For more than two years, my son has changed four accommodation families for various reasons. It can be imagined that it is also a difficult two and a half years. Many problems were unforeseen problems for us parents before going abroad. However, Dr. Zhang has worked hard to handle everything patiently and carefully. During this period, not only did the school express affirmation to my son, but also gave him a fully developed learning space. What's more, Dr. Zhang constantly communicated with us about the child's progress and gave us valuable advice. Now the child is going to the 11th grade. In the summer holiday Dr. Zhang is busy with helping the child to develop a new school year study and plan, so that we as parents would not be blind again and know how to train the child, and how to go further for the child's progress. Thanks for Dr. Zhang's great help to us. Her doctor's degree, senior teaching experience, and the enthusiasm to my son as if her own child won our unparalleled trust!</p>

									<p>Dr. Zhang Li, a person who is especially concerned and particularly responsible, I also called my older sister. I have known her for three years. On the first day of my trip to the United States, I was impressed by her great temperament. We just had a meal and chat, and then I thought that she was a very funny and strong girl, but at that time I didn't know if she could help me. </p>
									<p>The first year of studying in the United States was not very good. The school that I was admitted to was through a domestic intermediary, but after attending that school, I found that their discrimination against the Chinese was still very serious. Whenever we passed by, they would use some dirty words to swear at us, so that I had some setbacks in my first year of study and I had not learned anything. Then I thought of Dr. Zhang. I hoped she could help me transfer to a relatively quiet school for study. After knowing my situation, she quickly helped me with various procedures, so that I did not experience a complicated and tortuous process. In the second year, I transferred to MCA, a school that is small but very good. In the two years of MCA studying, I have made many foreign friends. They are very nice and very active. I am the kind of person who is shy. I could make friends with them because they are very friendly to me. Our school is not far from Li's home, so every time I met difficulties, Li helped us solve it quickly. If there is something wrong with the school, Li will immediately write an email to the principal or go directly to the school to help us to communicate. Li is a particularly responsible person. Moreover, Li treats every student whom she helped like her own younger siblings. When I am sick or in a bad mood, Li will comfort me and take me to the hospital and treat me to a meal. It's true that Li is the one who was the kindest to me and helped me the most in the United States in the past three years. I believe that every student or parent who is looking for a teacher to help study abroad will not regret finding her, because Li is so responsible for doing things.</p>

									<p>Teacher Zhang Li educated my son during his high school in the United States. When applying for the university, Dr. Zhang also helped. My son's grades are very poor with GPA less than 3.0, but Dr. Zhang helped my son apply to Binghamton University in New York State which is ranked 87 in the United States and three other schools, one of which offered my son a scholarship of $15,000 a year. Finally, my son chose to go to Boston University in Massachusetts to study and he liked the school very much.</p>
									<p>It is precisely because Dr. Zhang treats the child as her own. I am relieved to hand over the application of my daughter’s US high school to Dr. Zhang. My daughter's English foundation is weak. TOEFL was only 40 points. Teacher Zhang suggested that my daughter attend the summer camp of Albany College and actively took my daughter to participate in various activities of the community during the summer camp. Although only for three weeks, my daughter showed obvious improvement. It was because of these weeks of experience in camp that my daughter was deeply impressed by the teachers at Albany College, and she was lucky enough to be admitted by Albany College, the number one in New York State. During her studies at Albany College, Dr. Zhang strictly followed my daughter's progress and academic performance, and communicated with the teachers in various subjects in a timely manner. Every day my daughter was encouraged to bravely express herself and make friends. Dr. Zhang brings my daughter every month to participate in many community activities, volunteer activities, and leadership activities. Teacher Zhang saw my daughter's potential and strongly encouraged her to apply to the top female school in the country, Emma Willard School. My daughter's SSAT was only 1890, but she was admitted to Emma Willard School. A lot of children around us are better than my daughter. Their TOEFL is more than 110 points and the SSAT is close to full score but they were rejected by Emma Willard School.</p>
									<p>The professionalism of Dr. Zhang and her husband, Mayor Phil Barrett, is really unmatched in the industry of studying in the United States, and they also provide students with a platform that no other intermediary or educational institution can provide. What is even more commendable is that her team is a conscience team that really cares about education in the chaotic industry of studying abroad. My daughter has a qualitative change in terms of personality, ability, leadership, life skills, and communication skills.</p>

									<header class="major"><h2>Parents from Chengdu, China</h2></header>
									<p>From the knowing of Dr. Zhang to the successful application to the school in the short period of one month, it can be said that it is very efficient and the results are remarkable! Her professional attitude and very friendly laughter always give us peace of mind! Taking my own child as an example, I would like to talk about her professionalism and efficiency from both the child’s side and the parents’ side: </p>
									<p>Dr. Zhang is very good at tapping the child's strengths and tailoring goals and learning plans according to the child’s strength. She always encourages your child in time to help your child build confidence. </p>
									<p>My child did not learn TOEFL IELTS when applying for an American school, and she did not have any confidence in the interview in the United States. Dr. Zhang first interviewed my daughter on the phone and guided her to talk about her interests. Unconsciously, she could not stop talking for more than half an hour. My daughter gradually forgot the embarrassment of the interview and remembered the feeling of her glory. After the phone interview, Dr. Zhang immediately told my daughter that the admission rate was as high as 98%, and encouraged her to try harder to get into a higher-level high school, so that my daughter’s confidence multiplied and reserved more energy and motivation for the next study. Two weeks later, Dr. Zhang arranged for us to visit the school and interview in the United States. Since Dr. Zhang had established a good relationship with the school, my daughter passed the interview in a relaxed and pleasant environment. The next day after the interview ended, I received an admission email from the school.</p>
									<p>Dr. Zhang always considers from the perspective of parents and students, and shares and resolves concerns for parents and students in a timely and effective manner. In addition to children, we parents are also very worried about their language problems. Dr. Zhang recommended a simple and effective language learning method to eliminate our anxiety in time. In addition, after the child entered school, Dr. Zhang would also effectively plan and supervise the child's learning status and direction. During my daughter’s stay in the United States, she met another girl who lived in Dr. Zhang’s house. The girl grew up under Dr. Zhang’s attention step by step and eventually entered the top girl's high school. </p>
									<p>In short, I think Dr. Zhang's team service can be described in three words: intention, concentration, and reassurance. Coupled with our active cooperation, parents can be truly assured!</p>

									<header class="major"><h2>Parents from Beijing, China</h2></header>
									<p>Teacher Zhang Li has been helping my son since 2015. With any matters arising from his school, Teacher Zhang will always help to facilitate communication with the school when needed. For a period of time, my son was particularly rebellious, and my communication with him was not very smooth. Teacher Zhang was very patient and taught my son about learning, life, and American cultural habits. Teacher Zhang also visited my son regularly, taking him to buy any school essentials. On one occasion, my son hurt his head in a group activity organized by the school. My son asked the teacher of the school to take him to the emergency room, but the teacher refused because he thought the injury was not serious. Then my son called Teacher Zhang. She left her work office immediately to drive two and a half hours to send my son to the emergency room. She communicated with the doctor, chatted with my son and did not leave until my son was able to leave the emergency room and return to the school bus. My son later told me that Teacher Zhang had a particularly important report to be handed in on that day, and she would not be able to go home until half one in the morning. Teacher Zhang also helped my son to apply to a college. He didn’t have a TOEFL score, and his GPA was relatively low (less than 3.0). In the application, teacher Zhang highlighted his sports expertise and leadership qualities, which ultimately helped him to enter a very good college in Massachusetts and receive a scholarship of 15,000 US dollars per year. Now that my son is in college, I still liaise with teacher Zhang about his class selection and other related topics. Teacher Zhang is still patient to guide him, demonstrating that helping students to successfully study abroad and better integrate into American society and culture is not only a job for her, but also a mission. This is the most important reason why we trust teacher Zhang.</p>
								
									<header class="major"><h2>Parents from Tianjin, China</h2></header>
									<p>I met with Teacher Zhang Li because my child was forced to transfer. The school had cancelled the child's I-20 and we were not aware of it. When I entered US Customs, I was asked questions by the staff for more than an hour. Finally, I was told that I had to find a school that could admit my child within one week, otherwise we would have to leave. After finding Teacher Zhang through the recommendation of my friend, she started driving to the hotel where we stayed at two o’clock in the morning. After learning about our situation, Teacher Zhang immediately contacted a local private school for my child. Teacher Zhang helped us to deal with all the formalities of the school and find a good home-stay before leaving. We are very grateful for this. Because of my child's accommodation problem, we intended to transfer him to another school where we could live close to our friends. We asked Teacher Zhang to help us with this. She drove for four or five hours to meet us, and then accompanied my child to the school for interviews. The interviews went very smoothly and the school my child entered is one of the best private schools in the area, which we were very happy about that. Teacher Zhang is very sincere to us and very responsible in her work. She tries her best to help all students and is different from other intermediary service consultants. First, Teacher Zhang has obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in education in a US university, and has been living and working in the United States for a number of years. Teacher Zhang's qualification is the most trustworthy among all US school application and service organizations. Teacher Zhang is not only a guide for my child, but has also become a good friend of ours.</p>
								
									<header class="major"><h2>Parents from Guangzhou, China</h2></header>
									<p>Although we only met Dr. Zhang for the first time six months ago, we have maintained close communication because we have had to deal with various problems of my child during this period. Now with our current experience, we sincerely recommend Dr. Zhang to all parents. Firstly, her character is trustworthy meaning that parents can rely on her. Dr. Zhang can view any problem from the perspective of the parents when recommending the school and liaising between the student and the school, and can therefore recommend the best solution to parents. For example, in understanding that my child is rebellious and in order to avoid losing the tuition fee for the whole school year should my child drop out of school in the middle of the year, she worked hard to communicate with the school and finally secured a half-year tuition fee for us. Because of my child’s study-abroad, I have committed a lot of experience in dealing with various schools and intermediaries. The former intermediaries simply cooperated with the school to persuade students to drop out of school, resulting in no improvement opportunities for students, and parents losing tuition fees for the entire school year! In contrast, Dr. Zhang communicated with the school and parents often to help students improve. We deeply felt the sincerity and pragmatism of her work! Secondly, Dr. Zhang has more education resources and can provide information on suitable schools for students. When I met Dr. Zhang, my child had just been persuaded to drop out of the school. When I was very worried, Dr. Zhang quickly found a suitable school for my child's situation and persuaded the school to agree to give the child a transitional period and complete all the transfer within one week, so that my child could continue his studies smoothly. Thirdly, her professionalism is strong and trustworthy. In the process of dealing with my child’s matters, Dr. Zhang provided legal advice and professional opinions. Seeing the effect of psychological problems for international students, she decided to train in psychological counseling to help solve the problems between children and their parents more professionally. I believe that with her learning ability, she will continue to improve! We thank Dr. Zhang for her hard work and I wish her good work and great achievements in the future!</p>
